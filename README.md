# Jack VM Translator to Hack Assembly Code

This project is my week 1&2 project for the Nand2Tetris course part 2 to translate the Jack VM language into Hack Assembly.
A lot of inspiration in dealing with files is taken from [DrakoGNU](https://github.com/DrakoGNU/), specifically this [reposotry](https://github.com/DrakoGNU/DrakoVM).
